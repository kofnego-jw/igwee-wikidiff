    <h1>igwee-WikiDiff user manual</h1>

    <h2>For those in a hurry...</h2>
    <p>Following these steps and get igwee-wikidiff running.</p>
    <p><b>Prerequisite:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Java 8 SE if you want to run the application, Java 8 JDK and
            <a href="http://maven.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Maven</a> if you need
            to compile the application.
        </li>
        <li>A modern browser supporting FileAPI. I assume that IE 11, Firefox 45, Chrome 45 will work.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Compiling:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the source codes from github, it should contains at least a pom.xml file and the src folder.</li>
        <li>Switch to the folder containing the pom.xml and compile the source code with Maven using "mvn clean
            package".
            After the compilation, a file called
            "igwee-wikidiff-webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" will be created in the target directory.
        </li>
        <li>Alternatively you can also get a precompiled jar file from a friend. (Or write an email to me.)</li>
        <li>Please note that while compilation maven will try to contact Wikipedia to download revision files. If
            you wish to skip these tasks, use "mvn clean package -DskipTests" to skip tests.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Running:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the jar file to a working directory, the directory need to be writable for the user who
            starts the program. And the port 1414 needs to be free.
        </li>
        <li>Start the program in the terminal with "java -jar igwee-wikidiff-webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar".</li>
        <li>Open a browser and surf to <a href="http://localhost:1414/" target="_blank">http://localhost:1414/</a>
            and get the thing running.
        </li>
        <li>If the port 1414 is not free, but --say-- 12345 is, start the program with
            "java -jar igwee-wikidiff-webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=12345" and surf to
            "http://localhost:12345/". Please note that if your computer does not have a firewall, this port
            will be a potential weak point for hackers.
        </li>
        <li>Using "Ctrl + c" in terminal to terminate the program.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Main Goal of this app</h2>
    <p>This app should aid people view and review revisions of Wikipedia Articles and Wikipedia Discussions. It
        provides the following functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uploading a Wikipedia Export File or direct download (optional auto ingest) an article from
            English or German Wikipedia site. You can also try to download the archived pages from the Talk:
            (or Diskussion:) namespace. You must first know how many archived pages there are!
        </li>
        <li>View each revision</li>
        <li>Compare two revisions</li>
        <li>List authors of each revision and view their corrections</li>
        <li>Fulltext Search within the revision file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How this program works</h2>
    <p>The program takes an XML-export file from Semantic Media Wiki, and runs different XSLT Stylesheets
        to get the data. These data is then provided to the user through a web interface. The following data
        processing methods are used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get a list of revisions and contributors.</li>
        <li>View a revision (using the Bliki Wiki library)</li>
        <li>View the differences between revisions (use the Google Diff-Match-Path library)</li>
        <li>View revisions by user</li>
        <li>Implementation of Fulltext search. This is experimental for the project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <p>There are several difficulties with this app. Many of them are due to the fact that this app
        is developed for academic use on a single computer. Therefore these difficulties will stay. Others
        are simply bugs :)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can only review one XML file, the file you uploaded. After a successful upload,
            the index will be cleared and the old source of the transformation will be replaced with
            the new one. I.E.: If you upload a new XML, the old one will be erased.
        </li>
        <li>There is no log... Well, you could turn it on, although the logs will probably be of
            less use...
        </li>
        <li>Only XML export in the current version (as 2016-06-14) is supported. Future export formats
            will probably break the application. But this is okay.
        </li>
        <li>User coming from an IP (without logging themselves to WikiPedia) is shown as if their usename
            is [ip:###.###.###.###].
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>PS</h4>
    <p>Why is this file called readme? I don't think I am readable, except for psychics perhaps. And if I refer
        to this document with "me", wouldn't this be a ticket to psychiatry? Why is this document not called
        "readthis"?</p>
